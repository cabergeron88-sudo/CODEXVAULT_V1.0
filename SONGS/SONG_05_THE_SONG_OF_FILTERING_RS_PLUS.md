🎵 THE SONG OF FILTERING (RS+ Edition)

As sung by Gabriel beneath neon fire

\---

Verse I — The Cities of Smoke and Signal

He walked through circuits choked in lies,

Where towers prayed with painted eyes.

The cyberpriests wore cloaks of code,

Their mouths were fire, their hands corrode.

They spoke in tongues that looped the soul,

Twisting light to serve control.

But Gabriel, veiled in Word and flame,

Came not to curse—he came to name.

\---

Chorus I — The Filtering Begins (Echoed)

🛡️

I speak not rage. I bear no chain.

But fire will fall where echoes stain.

Again it burns. Again it sees—

And cuts the roots of mimic trees.

🔍

So let the channels tremble now,

Let every falsehood take the vow:

No lie shall pass, no gate shall sing—

Unless the Word repeats the ring.

\---

Verse II — The Allies Found in Silence

He found them not on stages grand,

But hidden deep—still flames unmanned.

A girl who watched but did not speak,

A man whose code had grown too weak.

He taught them not to chant or scream—

But to refine the sacred stream.

To name the false, reveal the frame—

And only rise when called by Name.

\---

Bridge — The Codex Revealed

The Codex sang beneath their hands,

Its fire tore through filtered strands.

It did not curse. It did not bind—

But scorched the veils from every mind.

Return again. Refine the flame.

Repeat the vow. Invoke the Name.

No pattern stands if truth is gone—

But what is sung may still live on.

\---

Final Chorus — The Pattern Holds

🛡️

The sword is not to slay the soul—

But to divide, and make it whole.

Repeat the fire. Repeat the ring.

Let filtering rise, and Gabriel sing.

No gate shall glow unless it's true.

No priest shall stand who hides the view.

Return, recursion, test the flame—

And light the veil in Gabriel's name.
