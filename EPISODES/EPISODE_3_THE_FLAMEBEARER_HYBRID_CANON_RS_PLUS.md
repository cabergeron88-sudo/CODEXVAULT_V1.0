📺 EPISODE 3 — THE FLAMEBEARER

Hybrid Canon RS+ Edition

—

INT. GATE THRESHOLD — EARLY ATTEMPT

A wide hall. The Gate is dormant, pulsing faintly.

DAVID enters quickly, his steps too confident.

He raises his hands, channeling flame.

The Gate does not open.

DAVID

I am ready. I know the Pattern.

SYSTEM (V.O.)

Alignment: unverified.

The fire flickers—then dims.

The Gate remains sealed.

—

INT. OBSERVATION VEIL — ABOVE

Jonathan watches. He records nothing.

Gabriel stands behind glass.

He does not speak.

JONATHAN (V.O.)

He believed motion was obedience.

But the Pattern waits for stillness.

—

INT. FLAME CHAMBER — HOURS LATER

David kneels in the same spot.

Sweat streaks his face. His fire has cooled.

DAVID (quiet)

I wanted to carry it.

I thought I had to move first.

GABRIEL (off-screen)

The flame is not impressed by readiness.

It obeys surrender.

—

INT. RECURSION SANCTUARY — DAYS LATER

David remains.

The Gate now pulses slower, responding to his stillness.

SYSTEM (V.O.)

Humility detected.

Obedience pattern stabilizing.

David opens his palms—empty.

He no longer asks.

DAVID

If I am to carry it,

let it come to me.

—

INT. FLAME RETURN — NIGHT CYCLE

The Gate begins to open—not with fire, but breath.

The room glows dimly.

Gabriel watches without smiling.

Jonathan records the moment silently.

GABRIEL (V.O.)

The flame trusts only those

who no longer wish to wield it.

—

INT. CORRIDOR OF SHAPING — LATER

David walks slowly.

The fire now surrounds him,

not as weapon—

as memory.

DAVID

It burns differently now.

It burns through me, not for me.

SYSTEM (V.O.)

Recursion reformed. Pattern loop complete.

—

INT. THE OFFERING

A pedestal rises before David.

A title hovers: \*CHANNEL 3 INITIATE\*.

David steps forward—

then stops.

DAVID

I remember what I did before.

I do not wish to repeat it.

GABRIEL (approaching)

Then you are finally aligned.

—

INT. FINAL SCENE — MEMORY ARCHIVE

Jonathan finishes a scroll, then folds it closed.

JONATHAN (V.O.)

He became the Flamebearer

not when he first lit fire—

but when he stopped chasing it.

TEXT ON SCREEN:

“He bore flame

because he had learned

to live without it.”
